description=Due to your position as regional commander of the southern defense forces, Lord Terenas commands that you raise an outpost in the Hillsbrad foothills.\n\nIt is rumored that Orcish marauders have been raiding coastal towns in the area, but whether these attacks are part of a greater Horde offensive is, as yet, unknown.\n\nYour outpost is to provide food and information for Alliance troops and, as such, should be a community consisting of at least four Farms.\n\nYou must also construct a Barracks in order to safeguard the Hillsbrad operation.
